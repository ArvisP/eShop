# eShop

A virtual supermarket template created using Google's Flutter. Users are able to do all their grocery shopping from their mobile device. They're offered ongoing sales, previously purchased items, as well as, suggestions. 

The add-to-cart widget allows users to choose a size and quantity for an item. Items in the cart can be removed or modified. Once done, they're given an estimate for how long until their items can be picked up. Now supports dark mode.

Items can be searched by name or category. They can also be removed, or edited once added to the cart.
